# Energy Consumption
This is to measure the power consumption of Server-Pi using Measuring-Pi with INA219.

## Run codes
```
$ cd energy_consumption/
$ python3 json_ina219_datarecorder.py
```

It will generate `JSON` file like the following.

```
[
	{
		"datetime": "2020-03-25T16:22:41.297335",
		"psu_voltage": 4.82905,
		"shunt_voltage": 0.04505000000000001,
		"bus_voltage": 4.784,
		"current": 0.4505,
		"power": 2.156
	} ,
